# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a webpage built to be a study guide for a web development bootcamp student. This is to be used as a resource while taking the class. This webpage helps any student taking a web development bootcamp class in case they need to look back and learn what HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and GIT mean. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. I also learned how to use the command line, and how to use reposititories. 

## Installation

## Usage

In order to use the website each section contains information on the following topic: HTML, CSS, GIT, and JAVASCRIPT. If information is needed for one topic or all, simply find the topic and read that topic. JAVASCRIPT is also running if you open the Devtools console. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
